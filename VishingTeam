Voice phishing is a growing threat in the digital age, particularly for Android users who are increasingly targeted by sophisticated attackers. The real-time nature of vishing, coupled with the lack of visual cues, makes it a challenging threat to detect and mitigate. However, by leveraging advanced technologies such as AI, machine learning, and voice biometrics, we can develop effective solutions to protect users from these attacks. Continued research and user education are essential in staying ahead of the evolving tactics used by cybercriminals.
